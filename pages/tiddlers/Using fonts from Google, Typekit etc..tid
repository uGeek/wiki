Instructions from: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tiddlywiki/mnC7gOHzv0Y

Create a new tiddler named as you like with the tag ``$:/tags/RawMarkup`` and add the link to your font :

```
<link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poiret+One' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
```

And that's pretty much it... Now you can create a new tiddler named as you like with the tag ``$:/tags/Stylesheet`` and put your css in there, for instance :

```
html span.tc-title{
  color: red;
  font-family: "Poiret One", "Impact";
}
```
