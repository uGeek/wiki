title: How to install a plugin
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A simple example that works by dragging a link from a tiddler onto a webpage containing the target wiki is found here: http://tiddlywiki.com/markdowndemo.html

To install plugins contained as files in your Node.js tiddlywiki source directory see also: [[How to install a theme?]].  The procedure for plugins is similar.  See also: [[Enabling an installed theme or plugin]].
