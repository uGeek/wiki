title: Multiple wikis on node.js
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

On the Tiddler titled "TiddlyWiki on Node.js" in http://tiddlywiki.com/ the following feature is mentioned: 

<<<
The ability to build multiple wikis that blend different combinations of shared and unique content
<<<

However it is not clear how this can be implemented.
