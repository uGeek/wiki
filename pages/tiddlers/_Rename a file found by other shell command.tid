title: _Rename a file found by other shell command
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Start with the examples found here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7450818/rename-all-files-in-directory-from-filename-h-to-filename-half.

After some tries, following command is close to the final solution: 

```
mv $HOME/Downloads/`ls -t ~/Downloads | head -n 1` ./converted_wiki.html
```
